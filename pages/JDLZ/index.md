JDLZ is a proprietary compression format, based on [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm). It is often used to compress [VPAK](../VPAK/) files. JDLZ compressed files often have the .lzc extension. JDLZ compression is also used in some other EA games, outside of Need for Speed.
