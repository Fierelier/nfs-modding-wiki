# Welcome
Welcome to the main page! The Need for Speed Modding Wiki is the place to share knowledge about modifying NFS titles.

[No, we don't have a Discord](http://andrewph.org/discord-sucks-for-information-sharing). If you would like to commit changes or talk, do so at [our GitHub page](https://github.com/Fierelier/nfs-modding-wiki). The wiki can be cloned and hosted by anybody, as such, it is unlikely to just disappear. [Just pull your own backup](../Making%20a%20backup%20of%20the%20wiki/) from the git. The entire Wiki is static, and can be uploaded to any basic web provider.
